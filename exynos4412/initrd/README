1) To open the ramdisk image, run
./open-ramdisk.sh coaxcopter_ramdisk.img
This will create a ramdisk/ folder that you can then go through and modify to your taste.

2) Once done modifying, run
./build-ramdisk.sh my_new_ramdisk.img
This will build a new ramdisk image based on the previously created ramdisk/ folder.
